# Drupal 9 Upstream for UCSB Student Affairs Websites

This is Pantheon's recommended starting point for forking new Drupal upstreams that work with the Platform's Integrated Composer build process. The custom upstream includes the UCSB's Web theme with modifications and several custom modules.

To get started, there are accounts and tools that require registration prior to getting started.

### You will need:

* A GitHub account connected to the [UCSB organization](https://github.com/ucsb/github-guide) if you plan on contributing to this upstream.

* A Pantheon account setup using the EDU pathway during [registration](https://pantheon.io/register).

* [Terminus, the Pantheon command line tool](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/install/) (recommended for developers)

* The codebase uses a CSS-preprocessor called Sass for our styles. We recommend all style changes be made using SASS and are compiled accordingly.

* We use a custom development workflow while implementing new features for the upstream. Please contact us to request more information.
