# Editing the Data Literacy Series Page.


## Add a new DLS Post:
- Go to Manage >> Content >> Add Content >> DLS Post
- If you want to add a tag to the DLS post, but there is no existing tag of the same name, you will have to create a new tag.  This is very easy and it is showed how to do so below.
- Notes: DLS Media PDF is for adding the PDF that will be displayed in the post's thumbnail.  It will ask you to add or select the PDF.  You will first need to add the PDF, then it will appear for you to be able to select it.  Then, the DLS File input is for the alternate PDF file if there is one.  

## Edit/Delete DLS Post:
