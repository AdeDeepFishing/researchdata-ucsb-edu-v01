# Editing the Communities Page.

## Add a new Community:
- Go to Manage >> Content >> Add Content >> Community
- Title is important for the Community name (ie so you can search for it in case you need to edit it later), but it will not be displayed on the community page.
- Displayed Title/Logo is what will be displayed on the page as the Community's title.  Click on 'source' to enter or edit the HTML of it.  You can also change the text size by clicking the button that either says 'Normal' or 'Format'.  
- Body is the text displayed as the Community's body.  You can also click on 'source' here and also change the text size.
- Community-Label: Add 1 or more groups of which the community is open to.  (ie: undergrad, faculty etc.) Click "Add another item" to add multiple.
- Destionation URL is for the URL of the community.  
- - Community-Mode: Add if community is hybrid, remote, or in person.  

## Edit/Delete Community:
- Go to Manage >> Content
- In the filter, you can search for the title of the Community you are looking for.  You should also use the 'Content Type' dropdown and change it to 'Community'.  

## Edit Community Page:  
- Go to Manage >> Content
- In the Filter 'Content Type' dropdown, change it to 'Basic page'.  Then the title is 'Communities'  
- Alternatively, on the Communities page there is an Edit Button
- The top image is under "Hero"
- The other content is under Main Content, including the Communities View.

## Edit the Communities View:
- The view is the list of communities.
- Structure >> Views >> Communities
- The view is mostly structured by custom templating and css.  The template file is under code/web/themes/ucsbwebrdhsub/templates/node--community.html.twig and the css is under  code/web/themes/ucsbwebrdhsub/css.  If you are editing the template, then I recommend reading the documentation in DEVS.  

## Edit Community Content Type / Node:
- Structure >> Content Types >> Community
