# Editing the Communities Page.

## Add a new Community:
- Go to Manage >> Content >> Add Content >> Community
- Title is important for the Community name (ie so you can search for it in case you need to edit it later), but it will not be displayed on the community page.
- Displayed Title/Logo is what will be displayed on the page as the Community's title.  Click on 'source' to enter or edit the HTML of it.  You can also change the text size by clicking the button that either says 'Normal' or 'Format'.  For adding an image/logo as the title, there are more details later.
- Body is the text displayed as the Community's body.  You can also click on 'source' here and also change the text size.
- text color and opacity is black on default, and changes the Title and Body text color. 
- Community-Label: Add 1 or more groups of which the community is open to.  (ie: undergrad, faculty etc.)
- Destionation URL is for the URL of the community.  

## Edit/Delete Community:

- In the filter, you can search for the title of the Community you are looking for.  You should also use the 'Content Type' dropdown and change it to 'Community'.  

## Edit DLS Page:
