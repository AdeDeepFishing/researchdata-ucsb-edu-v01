# Editing the Communities Page.

## Add a new Community:
Go to Manage >> Content >> Add Content >> Community
Communities are highly customizable, and so there are lots of values.
- Title is important for the Community name (ie so you can search for it in case you need to edit it later), but it will not be displayed on the community page.
- Displayed Title/Logo is what will be displayed on the page as the Community's title.  Click on 'source' to enter or edit the HTML of it.  You can also change the text size by clicking the button that either says 'Normal' or 'Format'.  For adding an image/logo as the title, there are more details later.
- Body is the text displayed as the Community's body.  You can also click on 'source' here and also change the text size.
- text color and opacity is black on default, and changes the Title and Body text color.  Recommended to use Opacity 1 always, and white text (#ffffff) if you plan to have a background image.
- 'IMAGE' - This is NOT displayed on the Community by default.  This field allows you to add an image to either the body or the displayed title/logo fields.  You must first upload any images you want to use into this field.  What this does is it uploads the image to the server's database so that you can use it.  To use the image in either the Displayed Title/Logo or the Body fields: go to the text box of where you want to insert the image; click on the icon that looks like a folder that has a label "Insert images using Imce file manager" when you hover over it.  Go to the Year-Month folder of when you uploaded your image, then select your image.  To adjust the size of the image, click the 'source' button, and change either the value for 'width' or for 'height'.  
- Community-Label: Add 1 or more groups of which the community is open to.  (ie: undergrad, faculty etc.)
- Destionation URL is for the URL of the community.  
- Background image is the image that will be used as a background for the community.
- Title block image is for an image you want to display above the displayed title of the community.  You could also use the Title Block Image in place of the Displayed Title/Logo if you want by leaving the Displayed Title/Logo textfield empty.  
- Background color is not displayed if you have a background image.
- Overlay Opacity is for the overlay that goes over the background image. For example, you may need to make the background image darker so that it is easier to see the text, so you would increase the overlay opacity to 0.6 or something.
