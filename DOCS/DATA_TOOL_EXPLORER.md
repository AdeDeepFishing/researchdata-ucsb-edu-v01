# Editing the Data Tool Explorer Page.

## Add a new Software/Service:
- Go to Manage >> Content >> Add Content >> Service
- The "Title" is for the name of the software.  The "Summary" is what is displayed on the purple card / selector table.  Keep it short.  You can add more details to this
service later, because this is NOT what is displayed in the Comparison Chart (that renders below the selector table).  
- Pick all the relevant facet matches.  If you need to make a new one, there is more information on how to do this below later in this tutorial.  The facet matches also do not determine any information that is displayed with the service, but this information is necessary for the filter to work (On the page, this information is for answering all the questions under "Describe your Data").
- Service Paragraphs: This is for all the information displayed WITH the service (in the Comparison Chart).  Note that if you do not have information for some of the fields, it is okay to leave it empty.  

## Edit a new Software/Service
- Go to Manage >> Content
- In the filter, you can search for the title of the Service/Software you are looking for.  You should also use the 'Content Type' dropdown and change it to 'Service'. 

## Add a new Facet
- Go to Manage >> Structure >> Taxonomy >> Facets
- Here, you will be able to add new answers and 'questions' for the "Describe your Data" form.  Note that the 'questions' are not semantically structured as actual questions, but rather they are labels for the data for the form. Example: 'Application', 'Campus Provider', 'Availability,'... Also note that drupal does not very clearly distinguish the questions from the answers because they will both be labeled as 'facets'.  But you can create a hierarchy that will make drupal render some facets as questions and others as answers to those questions (more on this later).  
- The facets added here will be added to both the frontend (Data Tool Explorer Page) and the backend (Adding/Editing a Service as described above).  In other words, once you add a facet here, you will be able to select it for your service, and you will be able to see this on the Data Tool Explorer Page after.  

### There is an 'Add Term' button you can use if you want to add a facet.

### If you are just adding an answer to one of the existing questions on the form:
 - First find and remember the "Control Type" of the question: Do this by finding the name/label of the question, and click "Edit".  For example, the first question is currently "Application," and you can tell it's a question because it has a bunch of facets under it that are indented after it.  So if you were to add a facet under this question, first check the control type of "Application" by clicking "Edit" for it.    The control type is either "radio" or "checkbox"
 - The control type of the answer that you are adding must be the same as the control type for the question that you are adding the answer under.
 - Go back to the Facets page and click Add Term
 - Add the name and the control type and click "Save and go to list"
 - Search for the facet term you just added.  Click and hold the cross-shaped 'move' cursor that is on the term so that you can drag the term to another place.
 - Drag the facet to be indented under the question that your answer is supposed to be under.  Make sure that it is indented under the question in a way that is in line with the rest of the answers.  

 ### Adding a question:
 - Click Add Term
 - Choose control type: Radio or Checkbox.  Radio is for a question that can have only one answer.  Checkbox is for a question that can have multiple answers.
 - Using the cross-shaped 'move' cursor on the term that you added, you can click and drag the term to reorder where it is displayed.  Make sure that it is not indented under another facet because this will make it into an answer.  

 ## Editing other content on the Data Tool Explorer Page:
 - Unlike the other pages, editing the content of this page requires going into the code.  A pre-requisite is to have either a git connection estbalished, or by using cyber duck, so that you can commit the code changes to the website.  Since this requires going into the code, check under the DEVS docs for more information on how to edit the content.
